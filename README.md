# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are helping Pewlett Hackard prepare for a “silver tsunami”. First, we determined the number of employees who are likely to retire soon per title. Then, we identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentoring program.

We defined employees who are likely to retire as current employees who were born between the years of 1952 and 1955. We then concluded that if a current employee was born in 1965, then they are eligible for a mentorship program. 

## Results

We found some alarming results about the upcoming “silver tsunami.” Below is the table of the number of employees who are retiring per title.

The following are four takeaways from this analysis:
* There are 90,398 employees who are likely to retire soon
*	Just over 50% of these retiring employees are either an Assistant Engineer, an Engineer, or a Senior Engineer
*	There are 1,476 employees eligible for a mentorship program
*	For every 1 engineer eligible for a mentorship program, there are about 63 engineers who are retiring

## Summary

### Silver Tsunami

Based on this analysis, there are several roles that need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact. Specifically, Assistant Engineers, Engineers, and Senior Engineers will be desperately needed once workers begin to retire. Senior Staff and Staff are other roles where thousands of employees will be retiring soon. There are 90,398 employees who are likely to retire soon with the vast majority being in these five roles. Therefore, it should be considered a crucial strategy to begin hiring for these roles in large quantities. 

### Mentorship Program

As it stands, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees. There is only one qualified engineer for every sixty-three retiring engineers on average. This would mean that each qualified engineer would have to agree to be in this program and then be responsible for 63 other employees. This seems too impractical to be relied upon. It is recommended to laterally hire engineers at other companies in order to have a successful mentorship program. Another suggestion is to attempt to prolong the “silver tsunami” by encouraging those who will retire soon to mentor new hires themselves.

### Additional Queries

During this analysis, we found that the salaries for senior staff were not much larger than those who were recently hired. To obtain new hires in higher quantities, it is suggested that Pewlett Hackard should give more raises and monetary incentives for those qualified employees to join a mentorship program. The following table shows the salaries of individuals who are retiring soon.

Also, a discrepancy was found regarding managers. There are nine departments for Pewlett Hackard and yet the data show only five active managers. This can lead to confusion among the workforce and may hinder efficiency within the company. Below is the table showing all active managers.
